Throughout my 6 years of experience in private equity (PE), I have built multiple KPI dashboards for the portfolio companies of the PE funds to track both financial and operation metrics on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis. This experience allows me to work in the intersection of data science, finance, and business operations. The dashboards are proprietary and belong to the companies, so I can't share them. Thus, I have developed a sample dashboard using dummy names, inspired by the mascots of Northwestern (Willie the Wildcat) and Yale (Handsome Dan), to share as my work sample.
