Welcome to my portfolio where I share my work sample and projects.

The "work sample" folder contains projects I have conducted as part of my professional experience for 4 years as a data analyst. 

The "projects" folder contains assignments, analysis, and projects I have completed as part of my academic training at Northwestern as I pursued a MS in Data Science (MSDS) with a concentration on Analytics & Modeling. The projects contain reports and codes that demontrate my fluency in R, Python, and SQL. 

Since I have applied the knowledge I gained from the MSDS program directly to my work, the academic assignments in this "projects" folder use the same methodology and models as the projects I have done for work in real life. Thus, I have included the notes in the project descriptions, outlining my actual experience at work.
