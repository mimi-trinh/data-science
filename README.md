Welcome to my portfolio where I share my work sample and projects.

The "work sample" folder contains projects I have conducted as part of my professional experience for 4 years as a data analyst. 

The "projects" folder contains the projects I have completed as part of my academic training at Northwestern as I pursued a MS in Data Science (MSDS) with a concentration on Analytics & Modeling. The projects contain reports and codes that demontrate my fluency in R.

The "machine learning" folder contains assignments I have completed as part of my MSDS training. The summary reports and codes provided in this folder demonstrate my fluency in Python and deep understanding of the applications of ML techniques. 

Since I have applied the knowledge I gained from the MSDS program directly to my work, the academic assignments in the "projects" folder use the same methodology and models as the projects I have done for work in real life. Thus, I have included the notes in the project descriptions, outlining my actual experience at work.
